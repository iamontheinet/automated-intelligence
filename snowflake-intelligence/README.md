# Snowflake Intelligence Setup

This directory contains setup scripts for **Snowflake Intelligence** features: Cortex Analyst, Cortex Agent, and Cortex Search.

**Status**: Generally Available (GA as of Build 2025)

## Prerequisites

**Required:** Core setup must be completed first (includes semantic model stage creation)
```bash
snow sql -f setup.sql -c dash-builder-si
```

## Files

- `business_insights_semantic_model.yaml` - Semantic model definition for Cortex Analyst (uses logical table names for verified queries)
- `create_agent.sql` - Creates Cortex Agent in `AUTOMATED_INTELLIGENCE.SEMANTIC` schema for natural language queries
- `create_postgres_search_services.sql` - Creates Cortex Search services for Postgres-synced data (product reviews & support tickets)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Upload Semantic Model
```bash
snow stage copy snowflake-intelligence/business_insights_semantic_model.yaml \
  @automated_intelligence.raw.semantic_models/ --overwrite -c dash-builder-si
```

### 2. Create Cortex Agent
```bash
snow sql -f snowflake-intelligence/create_agent.sql -c dash-builder-si
```

### 3. Create Cortex Search Service
```bash
snow sql -f snowflake-intelligence/create_cortex_search.sql -c dash-builder-si
```

## What Gets Created

### Semantic Model Stage
- **Stage**: `automated_intelligence.raw.semantic_models`
- Stores YAML semantic model files for Cortex Analyst
- **Note**: Verified queries use logical table names (e.g., `orders`, `daily_business_metrics`) instead of physical table names

### Cortex Agent
- **Agent**: `automated_intelligence.semantic.order_analytics_agent`
- Created in the `SEMANTIC` schema using `AUTOMATED_INTELLIGENCE` role
- Enables natural language queries over order data
- Uses semantic model for context-aware SQL generation
- Requires `CREATE SNOWFLAKE INTELLIGENCE ON ACCOUNT` privilege

### Cortex Search Services
- **Service**: `automated_intelligence.semantic.product_reviews_search`
  - Enables semantic search over product reviews synced from Postgres
  - Search by review text with attributes: product_id, customer_id, rating, review_title, review_date
- **Service**: `automated_intelligence.semantic.support_tickets_search`
  - Enables semantic search over support tickets synced from Postgres
  - Search by description with attributes: customer_id, category, priority, subject, status, ticket_date

## Verification

### Verify Stage
```sql
LIST @automated_intelligence.raw.semantic_models;
```

### Test Cortex Agent
```sql
USE ROLE AUTOMATED_INTELLIGENCE;
USE DATABASE automated_intelligence;
USE SCHEMA semantic;

-- Ask questions in natural language
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
  'order_analytics_agent',
  'What were the top 5 products by revenue last month?'
);

-- Test discount analysis (now working with updated semantic model)
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
  'order_analytics_agent',
  'What is the impact of discounts on revenue?'
);
```

### Test Cortex Search (Product Reviews)
```sql
SELECT PARSE_JSON(
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
    'automated_intelligence.semantic.product_reviews_search',
    '{
      "query": "quality issues with boots",
      "columns": ["review_title", "review_text", "rating"],
      "limit": 5
    }'
  )
)['results'] AS search_results;
```

### Test Cortex Search (Support Tickets)
```sql
SELECT PARSE_JSON(
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
    'automated_intelligence.semantic.support_tickets_search',
    '{
      "query": "shipping delays and refund",
      "columns": ["subject", "description", "category", "priority"],
      "limit": 5
    }'
  )
)['results'] AS search_results;
```

## Advanced: Custom ML Tools for Cortex Agents

### Adding Trained ML Models as Agent Tools

You can extend Cortex Agents with custom ML models deployed as stored procedures. This enables natural language access to ML-powered insights.

**Example: Product Recommendations**

After training the product recommendation model (see `ml-training/`), deploy it as a stored procedure:

```bash
cd ml-training
snow sql -c dash-builder-si -f product_recommendations_sproc.sql
```

**Agent Tool Definition:**

```yaml
tools:
  - type: function
    function:
      name: get_product_recommendations
      description: "Get personalized product recommendations for customers in a specific segment using ML predictions"
      parameters:
        type: object
        properties:
          n_customers:
            type: integer
            description: "Number of customers to generate recommendations for"
          n_products:
            type: integer
            description: "Number of product recommendations per customer"
          segment:
            type: string
            enum: ["LOW_ENGAGEMENT", "HIGH_VALUE_INACTIVE", "NEW_CUSTOMERS", "AT_RISK", "HIGH_VALUE_ACTIVE"]
            description: "Customer segment to target"
        required: ["segment"]
      implementation:
        type: sql
        sql: "CALL AUTOMATED_INTELLIGENCE.MODELS.GET_PRODUCT_RECOMMENDATIONS(:n_customers, :n_products, :segment)"
```

**Sample Conversational Queries:**
```
User: "Show me product recommendations for low engagement customers"
User: "Which products should I recommend to inactive high-value customers?"
User: "Get me 10 customers from the at-risk segment with their top 5 products"
```

**Agent Response Example:**
```
Product Recommendations for Low Engagement (3-5 orders) Segment
======================================================================

Customer ID: 10045
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Powder Skis (Skis)
     Purchase Probability: 97.1%

Customer ID: 115561
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. All-Mountain Skis (Skis)
     Purchase Probability: 90.9%
  2. Powder Skis (Skis)
     Purchase Probability: 76.5%

Total Customers: 2
Total Recommendations: 3

These recommendations are based on ML predictions trained on millions of 
customer-product interactions. The high probabilities indicate strong 
matches for targeted marketing campaigns.
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Natural Language Access**: Users don't need to know stored procedure syntax
- **ML-Powered Insights**: Leverages trained models for intelligent recommendations
- **Formatted Output**: Returns human-readable strings perfect for conversational interfaces
- **Production-Ready**: Deterministic results suitable for business campaigns

**See:** `ml-training/README.md` for complete model training and deployment guide
